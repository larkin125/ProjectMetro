# ProjectMetro

Project Metro is a Online Multiplayer Post Apoclyptic Unity3d Game inspired by games such as Metro2033/Last Light, STALKER, Fallout and other such games.

At the moment, features are limited to basic concepts and the models are simple or free-sourced models. In the future the models will all be custom and will be created inhouse.

Any help with this game can be appreciated, if you wish to join the team; message Lewis Stockton @ LewisStocktonNovelist@gmail.com
